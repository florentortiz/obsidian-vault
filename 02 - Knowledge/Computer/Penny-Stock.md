# Algorithm Complexity

## Overview
Key concepts of algorithmic complexity analysis.

## Content
While being a curious reader of Due Diligences and financial analyzes on companies (and especially penny stocks) I recognized the pretty fluctuating quality of stock DDs on Reddit in general (from the plain pump and dump style, over crayon art, to simply awesome). Browsing the subreddit wiki and FAQ I realized that most of the (really good) articles I found were covering trading strategies and chart technicals, answering the question **WHEN to buy and WHEN to sell.** However, before I decide WHEN to buy a stake in a stock, I need to answer myself **WHAT to buy**. And the best basis (in my option) to decide WHAT to buy is simply a profound and comprehensive analysis of possible target companies. So, I would like to show you how I structure my DDs/analyzes and what might be specifics of penny stocks compared to an S&P500-stock analysis. The following mainly applies for long investments and is less important for day trading and riding the pump-and-dump wave:

**1)** **Get your target right: find the unicorn among dying companies**

When you invest in penny stocks you need to realize that your job is finding the unicorn, mainly dealing with two types of companies:

- **Early startups:** Even big players like Amazon once started out as small companies with IPO prices far below their current value (<2$ in 1997). But you need to make yourself clear that Amazon for example is the condensed result of economic survival of the fittest among A LOT of companies who lost the fight on the way. With 9 out of 10 startups failing, there are probably thousands of companies out there who will never make it – and hiding between them might be one unicorn. This unicorn is the hidden gem you want to find! If you want to know more on why startups are failing, check out the following Forbes article. ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/?sh=685987076679](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/?sh=685987076679))
    
- **Turnaround companies:** The second group of penny stocks is companies that were already trading on far higher levels in their past - maybe even hundreds of dollars. But due to various reasons, they dropped to levels below the magical penny stock hurdle. So, one could think: “If this company already traded 100$ it can easily go from 1$ to 10$!” Well, it's not that easy, since 9 out of 10 turnarounds are failing as well. And usually, there are pretty good reasons why a stock crashed so brutally. Those reasons might vary from balance sheet scandals, illiquidity or excess debt, or simply poor management. Sometimes, “dead cats bounce”, but in general we need to find the unicorn-like Ford Motor Company or General Motors ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertreiss/2011/08/22/why-9-of-10-turnarounds-fail/?sh=7eaec5b53f5d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertreiss/2011/08/22/why-9-of-10-turnarounds-fail/?sh=7eaec5b53f5d))
    

But how can you identify potential buy candidates among these failing companies? This question is not so easy to answer since there is no general approach for me. Sometimes I read articles on new technologies, shifting markets or heavily increasing demand, or decreasing supply scenarios. Sometimes I pick up some information in random chats with colleagues or friends or read interesting DDs on Reddit ;) Usually, this is (for me) not triggering the Buy-button, but triggering to dig deeper and start to investigate interesting companies further. Maybe you guys have an interesting early screening approach; so please share 😊 Personally, I prefer searching for early startup unicorns since I somehow believe that turnaround companies already had their chance, didn’t make it, and therefore lost their right to exist. So, the focus will be on early startups. Maybe I am gonna write a second one on turnaround companies sometimes.

**2)** **Apply for early startup penny stocks: Rate their degree of professionalism and activeness**

When dealing with early start-ups, I usually apply another filter before I start digging into financials. And the best starting point is the company website:

- **Rate the look and feel of their website:** Screen their website and check whether it feels professional to you: Is the information well structured? Does it look UpToDate or like a 90s self-made webpage? Are pictures high res or do they look photoshopped into the page? Check their investor relations presentation (is there even one!) with regards to quality, storyline, and density of information. Is the language they use formal or do they somehow try to promote or overly emphasize the greatness of their product/market development? End the end it's usually my gut feeling giving the yes or no.
    
- **Evaluate whether the company is still active:** Go into their news section and check the latest update: was it already months/years ago or do they inform on a weekly/monthly basis? Check for breaks in information patterns: did they inform weekly until one year ago and then suddenly switched to monthly?
    
- **Check the management quality:** Go into their management section: is the management team mentioned including professional pictures? Do they even have a team or is it a one-man show? In case you have doubts, check their LinkedIn profile. Do they have a suitable background within the right industry? Can they display a track record? Is their education professional or just some random degree from a crazy overseas university?
    
- **Is their trading volume above 100.000?** Not directly a website/activeness thing, but I also check whether the stock is trading in a high enough daily number. This is essential since you need enough market liquidity in order to be able to sell your shares if needed. 100.000# is for me usually a good enough number.
    
- **Check** [**www.otcmarkets.com**](https://www.otcmarkets.com/) **for obvious red flags:** Red flags can be various issues like low trading volume or lacking stock development over a very long time. Furthermore, some stocks are regular targets for pumps-and-dumps showing isolated peak-patterns with years/months of non-performance in between. Also, suspicious business changes are tracked. An example is EyeCity.com, Inc; it's their company name and their ticker is ICTY, yet they changed businesses from an eyewear company to a mining exploration company and no longer even own the domain that their business is named after!) (Thanks to CourageousApe and BAHatesToFly)
    

If I have a negative gut feeling after that I am normally directly out. If it's good, I move further to the next step.

**3)** **Understand their business model**

Once I have a good feeling about the company in general, I start to evaluate their business model. Usually, I deep dive into two dimensions a) Company position and b) Market prospects:

- **Company position:** Stay on their webpage and try to answer the question and understand what they are actually doing. What is their product and their target group? Try to understand which consumer problem they are trying to satisfy (Whatsapp fulfills the need for cost-free online communication, Amazon fulfills the need for easy online shopping, etc.). After you have a good understanding (maybe reading some online articles available) **ask yourself** **the question that distinguishes the true unicorn from the dying companies: “What makes them and their product totally unique?”** Do they have assets only they possess? Do they offer technology only they have? Is their retail organization or customer access outstanding? This unique value proposition (USP) can be basically everything. But it needs to be special, and a customer must be willing to pay for it. And what you often see with penny stocks: a copycat just copying the business model of a genuinely great company is usually not a unique (and therefore successful) company itself.
    
- **Market position:** After you understood the company and its product, try to understand the market they are operating in. Ask yourself how big the volume of the market is they are operating. Is it a huge, global market (e.g. e-commerce) or is it a small (local) niche market (e.g. local lemonade stand)? After evaluating the size, you should understand the dynamics of the market. Is the market dying (e.g. VHS rental) or is it increasing (e.g. online gaming)? High-volume & highly increasing market is the best combination there. Small volume & decreasing is usually out for me (no unicorn!).
    

After you evaluated company and market, you put these two dimensions together:

**4)** **Analyze their financials**

If your company is still in the race, then you should start digging numbers. The webpage (Investors Relations presentation) is often the best source since financials for penny stocks won’t be available on most database webpages. If you can`t find financials on the company webpage then this can be a bad sign as well (high debt, etc.). Usually, I start with the basics:

- **Do they have revenue?** Especially early-stage mining companies go public before they even build their first mine, with years away from final operation. Another indicator is when you can ONLY find concepts in the Investor Relations presentation.
    
- **Do they generate profit?** Especially in the early years, companies need to spend a lot of money before they earn their first dollar: asset investments, R&D and wages are usually the highest stakes during that phase. So missing profit is not a knockout criterion per se. But if they show no profit over years and refuse to give any profit prospects/forecast for the future you should be alarmed.
    
- **Is the revenue/profit growing?** Growth is for me a key penny stock figure since it’s a good indicator of whether a company does something right or not. Sure, it’s no guarantee that a company is a unicorn, but at least it's going in the right direction 😉
    
- **Do they have high debt?** The absence of profit in the early years usually leads to debt. So, debt doesn’t need to be something negative, since it shows that a company is willing to take a risk for growth (with is a good characteristic in my opinion). Debt simply becomes a problem when it’s getting so high that they cannot pay it back anymore. A helpful figure is the **Debt Ratio:** take the total assets and divide them by total liabilities. If a company has double in assets value than liabilities, the debt ratio will be 2.0. Be cautious when you see debt ratios anywhere near 1.0, and if you are selective, look for values of at least 2.0.
    

If you have a good feeling after that then you can apply some ratios to get an understanding, whether the numbers are financially sound and how the stock market evaluates the company. A good source for further penny stock ratios is the following article: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061915/most-crucial-financial-ratios-penny-stocks.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061915/most-crucial-financial-ratios-penny-stocks.asp)

**5)** **Check for catalysts**

Since penny stocks are typically low volume, news (being good or bad) usually draws attention towards the company and therefore can heavily influence the stock price. Catalysts can be anything that leads to a drastic change in a stock's current price trend. The most common catalysts come in the form of new, often unexpected, information that causes the market to reevaluate a company's business prospects (Source: wiki). Catalysts can be the following:

- Upcoming figures (e.g. annual meeting)
    
- New partnerships to be announced or deals closed (new deal equals new money)
    
- Official approval process progress (e.g. FDA approval for medical companies)
    
- New products to be launched/new markets to be entered
    
- Game-changing market conditions (e.g. nation announcing covid test strategy as a catalyst for selftest-manufacturers)
    

This part is especially important for mid-term holding strategies, since “buy on rumors, sell on news” works quite well with penny stocks. However, if you find the exact same news posted everywhere, especially when using only superlatives and/or sales language (e.g. “The drug that heals cancer – 500% stock potential ahead”), it might be a pump-and-dump indicator. A good article to identify a possible Pump-and-Dump can be found in the Pennystock-FAQ.

**6)** **Analyze risks and be brutally honest to yourself!**

Now, after spending quite some time analyzing a company in-depth you might be so convinced that you found the unicorn that you completely ignore any risks involved. This is the perfect moment to shut down your pc and go for a 30 minutes walk. After that come back to your topic and truly ask yourself what possibly can go wrong with your investment. Be brutally honest and do not lie to yourself, otherwise, it's your money you are going to lose. Paint a picture in your head about a future where everything that can go wrong, goes wrong.

Possible risks can be:

- Overpowered competitors that might push your company out of the market
    
- Substitute technologies that can make your product obsolete
    
- High debt that makes your company go bankrupt
    
- Negative FDA approvals or other regulation changes your company depends on
    
- To be continued…
    

In addition, you also can apply debiasing strategies. One of the easiest ways to apply this is by telling your friends, investment WhatsApp-groups etc. about your investment target and your reasoning behind it. Ask them for honest feedback or even apply the "worst-case-scenario"-fantasy together (Thanks toCapitol_Mil). Another strategy to apply can be "war gaming" which means that one of your friends takes on the perspective of a direct competitor of your target company: What will he do as a competitor to crush you? Is your company safe against those risks?

Now, with all facts lying on your table, you should **decide for yourself** whether you invest in the stock or not. Never invest purely in recommendations since you never know their hidden agenda or the quality of their reasoning.

Hope I was able to help you at least a bit with answering the WHAT to buy and you didn’t fall asleep during that long read 😉 Have fun with it! Happy for feedback since I always try to learn and improve!
